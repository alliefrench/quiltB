Quilt-B is an app to assist quilt designers in envisioning their ideas before
sinking time and money into constructing a project. The first version was built
as a hackathon project during my time at the Grace Hopper Program at Fullstack
Academy. I plan to expand what is now a front-end only app to save users
designs and add multiple square designs to the same quilt.

Thank you for checking out my app!
